# Requirements

`Python 3.6+`

I believe the only thing here preventing compatibility with Python 2.7 is [f-strings](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings). Pull requests are welcome, but also feel free to modify toward `string.format()` locally.

# Installation

Download the files.

# Usage
Open a shell (MacOS: Terminal.app; Windows: cmd.exe; Linux: you know what to do.)

Navigate to this directory.

Type `python cli.py`
